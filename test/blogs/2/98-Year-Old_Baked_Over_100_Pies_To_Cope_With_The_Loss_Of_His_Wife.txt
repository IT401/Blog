<p>When Leo Kellner's wife, Madelon, passed away in 2012 after 72 years of marriage, he was at a loss for what to do â€” until he rediscovered his passion for baking. The 98-year-old learned to bake from watching his mother, and is now using the skill to help him cope with the loss of his wife, and spread some love in the process. In this first year following his wife's death, Leo made 144 pies, and began making cakes the next year.</p>

<p>The Nebraska resident gives his pies and cakes away to help support good causes. According to Hastings Tribune, he has given baked goods to the hospice workers who cared for his wife, to his reverend, to other widows, to those who are ill, and to funerals at his church. He even baked a wedding cake. In keeping with this philosophy, he tries to make sure everyone can enjoy his baked goods, so he has a sugar-free pie for those with diabetes. He added that the joy for him is seeing the reactions people get from receiving his pies and cakes.</p>
